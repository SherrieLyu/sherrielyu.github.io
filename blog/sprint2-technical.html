<h1>Introduction to the Box Model</h1>
<p>Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. This often leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience, while limiting the views you can create. In this lesson you will learn about the box model, an important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.

If you have used HTML and CSS, you have unknowingly seen aspects of the box model. For example, if you have set the background color of an element, you may have noticed that the color was applied not only to the area directly behind the element, but also to the area to the right of the element. Also, if you have aligned text, you know it is aligned relative to something. What is that something?

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as living inside of a box. This is what is meant by the box model.

For example, when you change the background color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.</p>

<p>In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following aspects of the box model:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dimensions of an element box.</li>
<li>The borders of an element box.</li>
<li>The paddings of an element box.</li>
<li>The margins of an element box.</li>
</ol>


<div>
<h2>Borders</h2>
<p><span>A border</span> is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>width</strong>  The thickness of the border.</li>
  <li><strong>style</strong>  The design of the border.</li>
  <li><strong>color</strong>  The color of the border.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<span>
<h2>Paddings</h2>
<p>The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as <em>padding</em>. The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make content look less cramped.</p>

<ol>
  <li>padding-top</li>
  <li>padding-right</li>
  <li>padding-bottom</li>
  <li>padding-left</li>
</ol>
</span>
<h2>Margin</h2>

<p>Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. The margin property is used to specify the size of this space.</p>

<ol>
  <li>margin-top</li>
  <li>margin-right</li>
  <li>margin-bottom</li>
  <li>margin-left</li>
</ol>
  <h3>Auto</h3>
  <p>The margin property also lets you center content. However, you must follow a few syntax requirements.The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.</li>
  <li>Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.</li>
  <li>Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element’s border</li>
  <li>margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.</li>

</ol>
